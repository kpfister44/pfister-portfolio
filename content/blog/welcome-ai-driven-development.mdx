Welcome to my blog! My goal for this blog is to write about how I've been using AI-driven development and some thoughts about the whole process. I'm writing more for myself than others, as I find that when I write about something or teach something, I can sort out my thoughts and learn much quicker.

## A Quick Background

I didn't pick up programming until I was 26 (I'm 34 now) and I only recently completed a B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State. Programming is a hobby that I picked up, enjoyed immensely, and have continually dove deeper into. I've spent my career teaching social studies and special education in high school, but have recently switched to teaching computer science. I love teaching, but also love programming, so it's been an energizing change getting to combine both my passions teaching computer science.

## Why AI-Driven Development Is a Game-Changer

AI-driven development has been a game-changer for me because it allows me to dive headfirst into projects and new tech stacks that used to take me weeks to learn. I can now make useful things in a fraction of the time. A lot of the projects I've made help speed up or enhance my workflow as a teacher in some way. I've built an APUSH essay grader web app and a Swift Assignment Grader Java program, partly to see if I could do it and get it to work, but also to help speed up how long it took me to grade assignments.

They're not perfect, and I really only use them as an initial draft grade for students. I still need to get eyes on the actual assignments to determine if I agree with the draft grade or not, but the fact that I was even able to make these apps in just a few days is something that would have been unimaginable prior to agentic coding. It would have taken me weeks or months.

## The Reality of Limited Time

I have three boys at home (all 3 or under) and free time is all but non-existent for me. Being able to dive into a program or a train of thought for more than 5 minutes is rare at this point in my life. Claude Code allows me to not have to focus anywhere near the level needed when programming by hand, while producing code at 10x the rate. Almost all my hobby projects are small, niche projects that aren't meant to scale, so it's the perfect use case for agentic coding.

## What to Expect

I'll be extremely happy if I'm able to blog twice a week. Typically, the posts will be concise and targeted about something I'm currently doing with AI-driven development. I'm hoping by sharing my thoughts I can also clarify them. Maybe someone somewhere will benefit from reading it as well, but that really isn't my main goal in writing these posts.

That's it for now, thanks for reading!
